I really hate it when my team does the email game with files where everyone edits at the same time and sends it back to the requestor.  Now the requestor manually goes through each of those documents and updates.  It really drives me nuts.  We should be using a better document system like GitHub.
The current documents show a couple of examples of how data gets updated.  One manager updates an Excel file and moves it to the next manager.  It's a very antiquated process and one that we should handle better.
